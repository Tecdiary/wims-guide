Please check that you server is not blocking the curl request and secondly there are chances that CloudFlare might be challenging your request due to various reasons. Please check with your host and request them to white list CloudFlare IPs <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ips" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cloudflare.com/ips</a> Updating your Anti-Virus and Browser might help. You can check with your host too.</p><p>You can try different host and/or install it locally with any web platform <code>easyphp</code> / <code>lamp</code> / <code>mamp</code> / <code>wamp</code> / <code>xampp</code>.</p><h3 id="why-am-i-getting-500-internal-server-error"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-am-i-getting-500-internal-server-error" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why am I getting 500 Internal Server Error?</h3><p>You shouldn&#39;t get such error if the server requirements were fine while installing the item.</p><p>500 are server internal errors and you can check your server error log to get more details of the error, if you are on live server and not sure, you can check with your host. Once you have the error details please post on support portal (<a href="https://tecdiary.net/support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tecdiary.net/support</a>) with details, we will check and suggest you the solution.</p><p>You can check the Laravel logs in <code>storage/logs</code> folder too.</p><h3 id="mysql-cannot-connect-via-localhost-but-only-127-0-0-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mysql-cannot-connect-via-localhost-but-only-127-0-0-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> MySQL cannot connect via &quot;localhost&quot; but only &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;?</h3><p>MySQL will try to connect to the unix socket if you tell it to connect to &quot;localhost&quot;. If you tell it to connect to 127.0.0.1 you are forcing it to connect to the network socket. So probably you have MySQL configured to only listen to the network socket and not to the file system socket.</p><p>What exactly is wrong with your unix socket is hard to tell. But I recommend you to <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/can-not-connect-to-server.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read this page</a> on the MySQL reference guide.</p><h3 id="why-i-can-t-send-emails"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-i-can-t-send-emails" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why I can&#39;t send emails?</h3><p>Please double check your email configuration in .env file.</p><h3 id="why-i-am-getting-db-error-and-can-t-login"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-i-am-getting-db-error-and-can-t-login" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why I am getting db error and can&#39;t login?</h3><p>Please make sure that your database server is up and running, then check .env file in main directory for database configuration.</p><h3 id="why-some-items-are-missing-from-order-when-i-add-50-services"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-some-items-are-missing-from-order-when-i-add-50-services" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why some items are missing from order when I add 50+ services?</h3><p>There is no restriction in WIMS code on the number of order services. If you are having such issue, please check your PHP configuration file (php.ini) for <code>max_input_vars</code> and set it to higher number i.e, 20000. You might need to increase <code>max_input_time</code> and <code>max_execution_time</code> too.</p>',55);o.render=function(t,n,o,i,l,s){return e(),a("div",null,[r])};export default o;export{n as __pageData};
